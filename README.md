## Materia Theme for VS Code

Inspired by and derived from [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), with a few additions and personal tweaks. 

Made to fit [Materia GTK Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme)

#### Tweaks/additions
* Revamped color palette based on Google's Material palette (material.io)
* Better support for PHP and Vue
* Highlight current line number
* Highlight current indent guide
* JS/PHP tokens more in line with the Sublime theme
* Less noisy docblocks
* And more...

Workbench is of course fully themed.
