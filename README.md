## Materia Theme for VS Code

Inspired by and derived from [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), with a few additions and personal tweaks. 

This is a variation on [Material Basic](https://github.com/m-thorsen/vscode-material-mt),
made to fit [Materia GTK Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme),
with a revamped color palette based on Google's Material palette (material.io)

#### Tweaks/additions
* Better support for PHP and Vue
* Highlight current line number
* Highlight current indent guide
* JS/PHP tokens more in line with the Sublime theme
* Less noisy docblocks
* And more...

Workbench is of course fully themed.
